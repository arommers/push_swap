# Push Swap

Push Swap is a sorting algorithm implementation designed as a project for School 42. The program takes an unsorted list of integers as input and should sort integers in ascending order using only two stacks and a limited set of operations. The aim of the project is to test the student's understanding of various sorting algorithms and data structures and their ability to implement this in code.

In this repository, you'll find my implementation of the push swap algorithm, as well as detailed information on how to use the program and how it works under the hood. We've also included our thought process, optimization strategies, and some tips for how to approach the project. Whether you're a 42 student looking to learn more about algorithm design and optimization, or just someone curious about the push swap algorithm, I hope this repository will be a helpful resource for you.

## Installation and Usage

To install Push Swap [download](https://github.com/arommers/push_swap/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the program and use the command cd to move to the push_swap folder.

Run 'make' to compile all the files.
