# Push Swap

Push Swap is a sorting algorithm implementation project and part of the Codam/school 42 core curriculum. The project tasks the students with writing a program in C that takes an unsorted list of integers as input and should sort them in ascending order using only two stacks and a limited set of operations. The aim of the project is to test the student's understanding of various sorting algorithms, their corresponding complexities and data structures and the student's ability to implement this in code.

In this repository, you'll find my implementation of the push swap algorithm, as well as detailed information on how to use the program and some of its pros and cons. I've also included my thought process and some tips for how to approach the project. Whether you're a 42 student looking to learn more about algorithm design and optimization, or just someone curious about the push swap algorithm, I hope this repository will be a helpful resource for you.

## Installation and Usage

To install Push Swap [download](https://github.com/arommers/push_swap/archive/master.zip) the program and use the command 'cd' to move to the push_swap folder.

Run 'make' to compile all the files and run the executable 'push_swap' followed by a random number of integers

```
./push_swap 24 -1 5673 -298 69 420
```
## Instructions

To sort the input arguments, the Push Swap program uses two stacks (Stack A and B) and a set of allowed operations. It starts with all the numbers in stack A, and an empty stack B. The allowed operations include:

- `sa`: swap a - swap the first two elements of stack A
- `sb`: swap b - swap the first two elements of stack B
- `ss`: swap both - swap the first two elements of both stacks A and B
- `pa`: push a - take the first element from stack B and put it on top of stack A
- `pb`: push b - take the first element from stack A and put it on top of stack B
- `ra`: rotate a - shift all elements of stack A up by one. The first element becomes the last one
- `rb`: rotate b - shift all elements of stack B up by one. The first element becomes the last one
- `rr`: rotate both - rotate both stacks A and B at the same time
- `rra`: reverse rotate a - shift all elements of stack A down by one. The last element becomes the first one
- `rrb`: reverse rotate b - shift all elements of stack B down by one. The last element becomes the first one
- `rrr`: reverse rotate both - reverse rotate both stacks A and B at the same time

The goal is to sort the integers in Stack A in ascending order, using only the allowed moves listed above in the least amount of moves. The program will write each executed move to the `STDOUT` followed by a `'\n`. After running push swap, Stack A will be sorted and Stack B empty.

An example:

`./push_swap 54 0 -46 13`\
`ra`\
`pb`\
`pb`\
`ra`\
`ra`\
`pa`\
`pa`\
`sa`

These moves are realized by pointer manipulation of our linked lists.

## Approach

- Parsing, put numbers in stack A if no errors are detected. Each individual number/value was stored in a node of a linked list.
- Assign an index to each node and respective value.
- Check if the numbers in Stack A are all sorted. If so, end the program without printing anything otherwise sort and print the executed moves to the `STDOUT`.

When approaching the Push Swap project, one of the biggest challenges was deciding which sorting algorithm to use. The amount of algorithms to choose from, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, are plenty. However, at the time, I had limited knowledge of the efficiency of these algorithms, so it was challenging to make an informed decision.

After some research and experimentation, I ultimately chose to implement radix sorting. Radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts data by grouping elements into "buckets" based on their digits or bits. In our case the two buckets are our two stacks. I was drawn to radix sorting because of its efficiency with large numbers of input and the use of bitwise operations. Up until this point I wase aware of bitwise operations, but never had the opportunity to apply them. This seemed like a great occasion.

## Algorithm

Before sorting our list we simplify our numbers for two reasons. 

First, Radix sort is a linear sorting algorithm that works by sorting the elements based on their digits. It sorts the elements by comparing the digits at different positions in each element. Since radix sort relies on the relative order of digits within the elements, it can only sort non-negative integers by their binary, decimal, or other positional representation. Negative integers cannot be sorted directly with radix sort because their binary representation involves a sign bit.\
Second, radix's [complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms) is based on the amount of bits respresenting an integer. We can reduce our big numbers to, at maximum, the biggest index in our linked list. Significantly reducing the number of operations needed to sort.

For example, if we need to sort these numbers

```87 -487 781 -100 101 0 1```

We want to replace them with 0, 1, 2, ...

```-487 -100 0 1 87 101 781``` becomes ```0 1 2 3 4 5 6```

```87 -487 781 -100 101 0 1``` becomes ```4 0 6 1 5 2 3```

So, instead of sorting ```87 -487 781 -100 101 0 1```, now we only need to sort ```4 0 6 1 5 2 3```.

With this method we can simplify any list of integers to make them in the range [0,N) ( â‰¥ 0 and < N, N is the size of the list).

When binary sorting with radix sort, each element in the list is viewed as a string of bits, and the algorithm sorts the elements based on the values of each bit position, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant bit (leftmost). This process is repeated until all bit positions have been considered, and the list is sorted. As mentioned above, one of the reasons why we reduce the actual numbers to index values. Less bits to take into consideration.

#### The Actual Sorting

When we take our earlier input ```4 0 6 1 5 2 3``` their binary equivalents will be ```100 000 110 001 101 010 11```.
The first argument will be at the top of our stack and subsequent numbers will be added behind/below it.

Starting at the least significant bit, we use the `AND` bitwise operation [ARG & 1](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/bitwise-operators#and) and check to see if there is either a `1` or a `0` at that position.
If it's a 0 (lower in value), it get's pushed to Stack B, otherwise it rotates to the bottom. After all 0's have been pushed to Stack B, we push em all back to Stack A. Our list is now sorted at the least significant bit position in 0's and 1's.

```bash
100                             100
000                             000 
110                             110
001                    010      010
101             001    110      001
010             101    000      101
011             011    100      011
----   ----     ----   ----     ----   ----
a      b        a      b        a      b
```
We move over one bit and repeat this process.

```bash
100                             100
000                             000 
110                             001
010                    101      101
001             010    001      010
101             110    000      110
011             011    100      011
----   ----     ----   ----     ----   ----
a      b        a      b        a      b
```

Our list is now sorted for the second digit. We repeat this process one last time for the last available digit.

```bash
100                             000
000                             001 
001                             010
101                    011      011
010             100    010      100
110             101    001      101
011             110    000      110
----   ----     ----   ----     ----   ----
a      b        a      b        a      b
```

As you can see, the list is now completely sorted.

## Visualizer

Below we have two visual representations of our program sorting respectively 100 and 500 random values using the push swap visualizer made by [Emmanuel Ruaud](https://github.com/o-reo), that provides a visual aid for the actual sorting happening in real time.\
This tool gives us a visual representation of the steps and instructions taken by the radix sorting algorithm. It is specifically noticable that our algorithm sorts by dividing our list into two "buckets" or Stacks by constantly pushing all 0 values into the right part, stack B, and then returning them to the left part, stack A, before repeating it for the next bit position.

## Limitations

Although the radix sorting algorithm is stable and efficient when it comes to sorting a large amount of numbers, my implementation of it has areas where it sadly doesn't excel when limiting it to only two "buckets" or stacks. Specifically in the small to medium range of numbers. When we want to sort a small amount of input or when our input is almost completely sorted, safe for one or two elements, radix sorting on the bits will still take into consideration every bit position of every number. This makes it wildly inefficient in these instances. Especially when being considered in the context of the Codam/ School 42 assigment. During the evaluation your code will be tested with different and specific amounts of input. Each input will be allowed only a certain amount of instructions and will be rated accordingly. Small amounts of input therefor had to be hardcoded to conform to these requirement, where radix sorting just didn't suffice. Even in the instance of midrange input radix needed a suboptimal amount of instructions.

## Concluding remarks

Push swap was an interesting way to get my toes wet with the concept of sorting algorithms and everything it entails. Through the project, I gained a deeper understanding of how algorithms work and the principles that underlie them. Not only did push offer the opportunity to dive into sorting algorithms, it also provided a setting to fumble around with creating linked lists and manipulating them with pointers. Working with pointers is still a humbling experience but this project furthered my understanding and application of them.

Overall, I found the push swap project to be an engaging experience that deepened my appreciation for the intricacies of programming and algorithms. It challenged me to think critically and creatively, and provided me with valuable insights that I will carry with me as I continue to grow and develop as a programmer.
